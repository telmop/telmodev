My name is Telmo Pessoa Pires, and I'm a Machine Learning Researcher & Engineer. 
I'm currently working on a startup, stay tuned for more details soon.

Until recently, I was a senior engineer at the Machine Translation Team at Apple, where I worked on
multilingual translation, new model architectures, and other topics!

Before that, I was at Google AI NYC, which I joined as an AI resident. I replaced Google's
language-specific models with multilingual models supporting 100+ languages (this back in the good old BERT days).
I also worked on 3D depth estimation, with a focus on accurately estimating the position of moving objects. Fun times!

In my spare time I enjoy reading, working out, and getting computers to do stuff they weren't intended to.
