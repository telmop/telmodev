# About me

My name is Telmo Pessoa Pires, and I'm a Machine Learning and Software Engineer. I build ML systems from research to production, specializing in NLP, distributed systems, and ML infrastructure.

I am interested in deep tech, cybersecurity, and in particular in using Machine Learning (not just AI ðŸ˜‰) to solve real world problems - not just the next app.

I have worked at both large tech companies and early-stage startups. Most recently, I was Founding Staff Engineer and Head of ML at Equall, where I built the company's AI-powered legal due-diligence platform. Before that, I spent over five years between Apple and Google Research, where I worked on multilingual models, more inference-efficient Transformers, among other topics.

In my spare time I enjoy reading, working out, and getting computers to do stuff they weren't intended to.

I'm open to consulting opportunities and interesting projects.
